# BeatSaberMultiplayerLite [![Build](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberMultiplayer/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=MultiplayerLite&event=push)](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberMultiplayer/actions)
An alternative version of [BeatSaberMultiplayer](https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberMultiplayer). This fork removes support for CustomAvatars (among other things). It uses the same ServerHub version as Multiplayer, so people with MultiplayerLite can play with others using the full Multiplayer mod.
